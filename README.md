## 🧭 Overview  

While Planner 5D is widely used by architects and designers, it can feel overwhelming to the average person just trying to refresh their bedroom or plan a cozy home office.

- **AI Design Mode:** Upload your room image and describe what you want (e.g., “Turn this into a Scandinavian-style living room”).

With a clean interface, guided actions, and AI assistance, Planner 5D DIY turns complex design into a fun, friction-free experience.
